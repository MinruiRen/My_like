My key experiments for this year kind of failed, I don't know how to do 

[[2024-06-06]]
after two days I have some ideas of this time "bad mood". 

The first thing is that it’s always good when issues are exposed, because this is the earliest moment it can be found.

The second thing is that some problems will be exposed regardless of how well you prepare beforehand. Human effort cannot change this once it has revealed. Sometimes, a smooth process can be misleading, making me forget that what we are doing is called "scientific research", a field with inherently high failure rates. It’s something everyone should consider before entering academic : Can you accept it if, after four years, nothing is discovered?

The third thing is that because I have done a lot, I finally reached a point where I can directly know if the hypothesis being wrong. If science is a high-failure-rate thing, the more you do, the higher the probability of encountering failure. However, we cannot stop just because we fear failure. Failure is also a part of success. One shouldn't be disheartened twice by fear. 
Lastly, an imperfect analogy: projects are like our children. In real life, some parents raise their children for many years, only to find that they did not live up to their expectations. Yet, life goes on.

I am so happy, he could say that! #thesis
