**Self-introduction**  
Hello, my name is Minrui Ren. I am currently a PhD candidate and have experience in research, project coordination, and community organization. I am the founder of an outdoor activity community, where I organize events, manage participants, and maintain a welcoming environment. I have also directed and filmed three short productions, including a student military training documentary, a campus short film, and a documentary on bat exploration in Portugal. In addition, I operate a Xiaohongshu (RED) content account with over 2,000 followers, sharing creative and community-focused content.

**Why I want to volunteer at IDFA**  
I have been a fan of documentaries for a long time. **Last year, I attended the IDFA2024 screenings** and watched four award-winning films. Three of them left a particularly strong **impression** on me: _No Other Lands_, _Writing Hawa_, and At This Moment, in the Nation's Sky. While I used to mainly enjoy nature and animal documentaries, I have gradually started to appreciate social-science documentaries as well. I am fascinated by how documentaries capture human emotions, beliefs, and societal structures in a way that is authentic and vivid. Watching documentaries allows me to see “real foreign worlds,” beyond what books or travel alone can show. I have also started creating my own films to record contemporary life, which deepens my appreciation for storytelling and visual communication.

**Why I choose Industry Crew & DocLab VR**  
I am particularly interested in the **Industry Crew** and **DocLab VR** roles because I enjoy both supporting creative events and interacting with people. For Industry Crew, I am confident in assisting with venue setup, welcoming international guests, guiding them during the event, providing production support. My past experience managing events, coordinating projects, and supervising students has prepared me well for these responsibilities.

For DocLab VR, I am excited by the opportunity to guide visitors through interactive VR experiences, and explain various digital projects. My experience in filming, content creation, and engaging diverse audiences equips me to help visitors enjoy these innovative experiences. I love connecting with people and ensuring they have a meaningful and smooth experience, which aligns perfectly with both roles.

**Closing**  
Overall, I am enthusiastic, reliable, and highly motivated to contribute to IDFA. I believe my combination of organizational skills, creativity, and cross-cultural experience will allow me to make a positive impact as a volunteer.
I am generally available on weekends, which fits my current schedule best. However, I am flexible and willing to coordinate other times if needed to support IDFA events.
