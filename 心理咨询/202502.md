“I am a researcher in field XX and am responsible for supervising the research of two master's students.”
- “One of the students (R) is doing well, while the other (L) bothers me.”
- “I would like to be a responsible mentor who can push the students to grow as well as maintain a good working atmosphere.”
#### **2. Specific distress encountered**

- “L's work status is a headache for me. He is inefficient and often does unrelated things during work hours, such as internet chatting.”
- “I have tried a variety of ways, such as **increasing supervision, providing specific guidance, expressing my expectations, and even recommending counseling**, but his status does not seem to have improved significantly.”
- “He has made some adjustments as I have suggested, but overall I still feel that he is not committed enough to his work.”
- “I recently gave him a rating of 6/10 (on a 10-point scale), but afterward I had some regrets and wondered if I had been too harsh.”
- “I don't know how to get him to really commit to his research and I'm not sure if I'm asking too much of him.”

#### **3. Your emotional and psychological state**

- “I find myself feeling **angry, frustrated, and even a little guilty** about his behavior because I don't want to de-motivate him, but can't ignore his problems.”
- “I feel like I'm putting a lot of effort into him for very little return, and it makes me **frustrated and powerless**.”
- “Sometimes I wonder if I'm not managing him well enough, or if I'm not patient enough with people myself.”
- “Because of this incident, my stress level has become higher and it's even affecting my overall mood.”
### **🔍 Main points that can be discussed**

1. **How can I adjust my expectations? **
    
    - Should you accept that not every student will be passionate about research?
    - How can you find more realistic ways to manage this without compromising your own emotions?
2. ** How do you manage your emotions? **
    
    - Why do students' behaviors trigger your feelings of anger and powerlessness?
    - How can you avoid overexerting yourself and learn to **mentally “let go ”**?
3. **How do you set boundaries when managing students? **How much energy should you devote to this student?
    
    - How much energy should you invest in this student?
    - If there is a limit to his growth, can you set a “minimum requirement” and not let yourself continue to be anxious?
4. **How do you feel about grading guilt? **How do you feel about grading guilt?
    
    - Grading is an objective assessment, not a reflection of personal emotions. Do you regret giving a 6 because you are afraid you will be “perceived as less forgiving”?
    - The point of grading is to help students grow, not to take all the blame.

### **🎯 What do you expect? **

At the end of the conversation, you can ask the therapist** to help you find some specific ways**, such as:

- “I would like to find a better way to cope with this student without letting myself get too anxious.”
- “I would like to know how to adjust my mind so that this incident doesn't affect me emotionally anymore.”
- “I want to learn to more clearly delineate between ‘my responsibility’ and ‘the student's own responsibility’.”

### **📝 Summarizing**

**How do I describe this? **

- Describe your roles and responsibilities
- Describe specifically what bothers you (student's behavior + your feelings)

1. **How to adjust your expectations of the student** (acceptance of reality vs. continuing to try to change)
2. **How to manage one's own emotions** (keeping the student's problems from affecting one's self)
3. **How to draw boundaries of responsibility** (what is your responsibility and what is the student's own)
4. **How to deal with grading guilt** (fairness vs. personal feelings)
